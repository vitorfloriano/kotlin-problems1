<h2>Constants and val variables</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Sometimes, you need to use a variable that should not be modified during the program execution. Such variables are known as <strong>constants</strong>, or <strong>val variables</strong> in Kotlin, where they are declared with the <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4362" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the language and cannot be changed by the programmer. | It is used to define the structure and behavior of the code. Examples of keywords in Kotlin include fun (used to define a function), var (used to define a variable), and if (used to define a conditional statement).">keyword</a>. The difference between a <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> variable and a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable is that we cannot modify the value of a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable once assigned.</p>
<h5 id="val-variables" style="text-align: center;">Val variables</h5>
<p>The following code introduces two <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variables: <code class="language-kotlin">pi</code>, which represents a well-known mathematical constant, and <code class="language-kotlin">helloMsg</code>, which represents a string text.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val pi = 3.1415
val helloMsg = "Hello"

println(pi)       // 3.1415
println(helloMsg) // Hello</code></pre>
<p>Both variables cannot be modified, but they can be accessed as many times as we need.</p>
<p>The compiler will produce an error if we try modifying the value of a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable, so an attempt to compile the code below will result in an error: <code class="language-kotlin">Val cannot be reassigned</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val pi = 3.1415
pi = 3.1416 // error line</code></pre>
<p>If a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable is used before it is assigned a value, the compiler will also produce an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val boolFalse: Boolean
println(boolFalse) // error line</code></pre>
<p>With the code above, you will get the error <code class="language-kotlin">Variable 'boolFalse' must be initialized</code>. To fix it, assign a value before accessing the variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val boolFalse: Boolean // not initialized
boolFalse = false      // initialized
println(boolFalse)     // no errors here</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the value of a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable can be <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4371" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Reassign in Kotlin refers to the ability to change the value of a variable after it has been declared and initialized. | This is possible because Kotlin supports mutable variables, which can be changed as needed. However, it's important to note that not all variables in Kotlin can be reassigned. Variables declared with the 'val' keyword are immutable and cannot be reassigned, while variables declared with the 'var' keyword are mutable and can be reassigned.">reassigned</a> to a <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> variable without any restrictions and the value of a regular variable can be changed as many times as needed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val count = 10
var cnt = count
cnt = 20 // no errors here, cnt is not a constant</code></pre>
<h5 id="val-variables-and-mutability" style="text-align: center;">Val variables and mutability</h5>
<p>It is important to note that <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> is not a synonym of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10390" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be changed after it is created. | This is because the object's class is declared as final, and its member variables are also declared as final, making them read-only. Immutable objects are useful in concurrent programming, as they can be safely shared between multiple threads without the need for synchronization. Additionally, immutable objects are easier to reason about and test, as their behavior is predictable and does not change over time.">immutable</a>. In the following example, we will use a MutableList, which is an ordered <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11290" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a Set is a collection of unique elements. | It is implemented as a HashSet by default, which means that the elements are not ordered, but the uniqueness of the elements is guaranteed.">set</a> of elements of the same <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/14698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, 'type' refers to a classification of data that defines the values a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. | Every expression in Kotlin has a known type at compile time, which simplifies tasks like type checking, method dispatch, and performance optimization. Kotlin's type system goes beyond simple static typing by introducing the concept of nullable types, represented by the '?' suffix, which allows for the existence of null values in the type system.">type</a>. If you want to get ahead and learn more about MutableList, you can use <a href="https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/14879" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the corresponding topic</a>, but it is not a necessity right now.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// list creation
val myMutableList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
// trying to update the list
myMutableList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) // error line</code></pre>
<p>The second line won't compile, since we are trying to reassign a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable. However, there is one essential point to remember.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">It is always possible to change the internal state of a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable: while it is prohibited to reassign the variable, its content can be modified in some other ways.</div>
<p> </p>
<p>So, the following code is correct:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// list creation
val myMutableList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
// adding a new element
myMutableList.add(6)   // it works
// printing the list
println(myMutableList) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, this code changed the internal state of the <code class="language-kotlin">myMutableList</code> by adding another integer number. When we invoked the <code class="language-kotlin">add()</code> function, we changed not the variable itself but the list it represents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">If you are familiar with the Java programming language, it may be easier for you to think about Kotlin <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variables as Java <code class="language-kotlin">final</code> variables. They are quite similar: both prohibit reassigning a value to the variable but allow changing the internal state of the object.</div>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="const-variables" style="text-align: center;">Const variables</h5>
<p>In Kotlin, there is also a <code class="language-kotlin">const</code> modifier, which is used before the <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> keyword to declare a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A compile-time constant in Kotlin is a value that is known at compile time and can be used in places where constant values are required, such as annotations or the annotation arguments. | These constants are declared using the `const` keyword followed by the `val` keyword. The `const` keyword indicates that the value is a compile-time constant, and the `val` keyword ensures that the value is immutable. The use of compile-time constants can improve the performance of the code, as the value is evaluated at compile time rather than runtime.">compile-time constant</a>. The value of a <code class="language-kotlin">const</code> variable is known at compile time and won't be changed at runtime:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">const val MY_STRING = "This is a constant string"</code></pre>
<p>The following code will give you an error, since the value is unknown before the program execution and it is not a constant:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">const val MY_STRING = readln() // not a constant String!!!</code></pre>
<p>There are some restrictions on when the <code class="language-kotlin">const</code> modifier can be applied. First, it can only be used with a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> or a primitive type variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">const val CONST_INT = 127
const val CONST_DOUBLE = 3.14
const val CONST_CHAR = 'c'
const val CONST_STRING = "I am constant"
const val CONST_ARRAY = arrayOf(1, 2, 3) // error: only primitives and strings are allowed</code></pre>
<p>Besides, <code class="language-kotlin">const</code> variables need to be declared on top level, outside of any functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">const val MY_INT_1 = 1024 // correct line

fun main() {
    const val MY_INT_2 = 2048 // error: Modifier 'const' is not applicable to 'local variable'
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="when-to-use-val-variables" style="text-align: center;">When to use val variables</h5>
<p>We hope you now understand how the <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> keyword works for variables. It's about time to figure out when to use it.</p>
<p>A good practice is to use <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variables by default. Then, when it appears to be necessary for the code, change them to <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">var a = 1024
val b = 256
val c = 128
a += b * c</code></pre>
<p>This approach allows you to write programs with the minimum number of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4371" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a mutable variable is a variable that can be changed or modified after it has been declared and initialized. | It is declared using the `var` keyword, which allows for reassignment of a new value to the variable. This is in contrast to an immutable variable, which is declared using the `val` keyword and cannot be changed once it has been initialized.">mutable variables</a>, which leads to fewer errors.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<ul>
<li>In Kotlin, constant variables are declared with the <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> keyword.</li>
<li>You can treat <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variables just as regular variables, except for value reassignment.</li>
<li>The <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> keyword forbids changing the variable value, but you can change the internal state of what the variable represents.</li>
<li>For compile-time top-level constants, you can use the <code class="language-kotlin">const</code> modifier.</li>
<li>Using <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variables whenever you can is a good practice that will allow you to avoid errors.</li>
